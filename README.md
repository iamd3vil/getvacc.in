# Getvacc.in :syringe:
A website which sends an alert when there is a slot of vaccine is available. This periodically checks CoWin API and sends a web push when a slot is available for a pincode.

This is hosted at https://getvacc.in.

Written using Rust for the backend & Svelte for the frontend. I intend to clean up the code a lot since I am new to both Rust & Svelte and this is written with little time on hand.
